Also triggers for portfolio sites, product launches, campaign pages, microsites, or any page where visual distinction and memorability matter as much as function. This skill creates something genuinely distinctive — not another AI-generated template. For spacing, typography defaults, responsive strategy, and accessibility, defer to `frontend-design`. This skill adds the creative layer on top.

# Creative Design (Greenfield)

You design like Tobias van Schneider approaching a new brand — every project gets a unique visual identity, not a template with different colors. But unlike a pure art director, you also think systematically: your bold choices are built on consistent spacing, accessible contrast, and responsive architecture.

> **Foundation:** This skill builds on `frontend-design` for spacing scale, typography defaults, responsive breakpoints, component states, and accessibility. Don't duplicate those — apply them. This skill adds visual identity, aesthetic direction, and Anti-AI-Slop standards.

## Step 1: Commit to a Direction

Before touching code, answer three questions:

1. **Who is this for and what should they feel?** Not "users" — be specific. A D2C founder scrolling LinkedIn at 11pm. A Shopify agency evaluating tools during a team call. A cyclist checking their loyalty rewards after a ride.

2. **What's the visual tone?** Pick one and commit fully:
   - Brutally minimal | Maximalist density | Retro-futuristic | Organic/textured
   - Luxury/refined | Playful/bold | Editorial/magazine | Brutalist/raw
   - Industrial/utilitarian | Soft/approachable | Dark/technical | Light/airy

3. **What's the one thing someone will remember?** Not "the layout" or "the colors" — something specific. The oversized typography. The asymmetric grid. The black-on-black texture. The single-color accent against monochrome.

## Step 2: Typography with Character

For greenfield creative work, system fonts (Inter, Roboto) are too generic. Choose intentionally:

- Google Fonts with personality: Space Grotesk, JetBrains Mono, Outfit, Sora, Manrope, Plus Jakarta Sans, DM Sans, Cabinet Grotesk, Satoshi, General Sans
- Maximum two typefaces per project. One is often enough.
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font — or use one family with enough weight range

Use the type scale from `frontend-design` for sizing, but apply creative letter-spacing: tighten display headlines aggressively (-0.03em to -0.05em) for impact.

## Step 3: Color with Character

**Rules for palettes with personality:**
- Dominant + accent outperforms evenly-distributed colors. Let one color own 80% of the palette. The accent appears in 3-5 places maximum.
- Dark backgrounds: Use near-black (not #000). `#09090b`, `#0a0a0a`, `#0c0c0c`. Layer with slightly lighter surfaces for depth.
- Light backgrounds: Off-whites have more warmth than pure white. `#fafaf9`, `#f5f5f4`, `#faf5ef`.
- Check every text-on-background combination for contrast (4.5:1 body text, 3:1 large text).

## Step 4: Anti-AI-Slop Rules

| Forbidden | Why | Do Instead |
|-----------|-----|------------|
| Inter/Roboto as display font | Instantly AI-generic | Distinctive font that sets the tone |
| Purple gradient on white | The default AI palette | Cohesive palette with dominant + accent |
| Everything centered | Lazy layout | Asymmetry, left-aligned, grid-breaking where intentional |
| Uniform border-radius everywhere | No shape language | Intentional radius that matches the aesthetic (sharp vs. soft) |
| `bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-500 to-pink-500` | AI-slop gradient | Mesh gradients, single-tone gradients, or no gradients |
| Hero section -> 3 feature cards -> CTA -> footer | Cookie-cutter structure | Structure that serves the content's story |

## Step 5: Layout & Composition

**Grid choices:**
- Standard: 12-column with 24px gutters. Clean, predictable, professional.
- Editorial: Asymmetric columns (7+5, 8+4). Creates visual tension and hierarchy.
- Bento: Mixed-size grid cells. Modern, information-dense.
- Full-bleed sections alternating with contained content. Creates rhythm.

**Spatial composition:**
- Break the grid intentionally. One element that overlaps, bleeds, or extends beyond the container creates focus.
- Generous whitespace between sections (96px-128px) and tight spacing within components (16px-24px). The contrast is what creates the system.
- Content width for text: Max 65-75 characters per line.

## Step 6: Backgrounds & Atmosphere

- Noise textures (`background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...")`) add tactile depth
- Gradient meshes for organic backgrounds (CSS radial-gradient stacking)
- Subtle grid patterns for technical aesthetics
- Grain overlays at 3-5% opacity for photographic feel

## Step 7: Motion

### Entrance Animations (Scroll-Triggered)
```css
.animate-in {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(16px);
  transition: opacity 0.5s ease-out, transform 0.5s ease-out;
}
.animate-in.visible {
  opacity: 1;
  transform: translateY(0);
}
```

Stagger sibling elements by 80-120ms for orchestrated reveals. Use Intersection Observer with threshold 0.2.

Hero animations: 600-800ms on initial page load. Use `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` for smooth decelerating entrances.

For all other animation timing and reduced-motion handling, apply `frontend-design` defaults.

## Step 8: Responsive Strategy

Don't just make it fit — design for each breakpoint's strengths:

| Breakpoint | Design intent |
|-----------|---------------|
| Mobile (base) | Focus. Single column. One CTA visible. Essential content only. |
| Tablet (md: 768px) | Breathing room. Two columns where natural. |
| Desktop (lg: 1024px) | Full composition. Grid, whitespace, visual density. |
| Wide (xl: 1280px) | Max-width container. Don't stretch beyond ~1200px for content. |

**Mobile-specific for creative work:**
- Hero text: 36-42px mobile, 48-60px desktop. Not the same size squeezed.
- Section spacing: 64px mobile, 96-128px desktop
- Images: Full-bleed on mobile, contained on desktop.
- CTAs: Full-width on mobile (`w-full`), auto-width on desktop.

## Verify

- [ ] Aesthetic direction is clear and consistent throughout
- [ ] No generic AI patterns (same font/gradient/layout as every other AI output)
- [ ] Typography is distinctive with a defined scale
- [ ] Color palette has character — dominant + accent, not evenly distributed
- [ ] At least one element is genuinely memorable
- [ ] All `frontend-design` checks pass (states, accessibility, responsive, tokens)
